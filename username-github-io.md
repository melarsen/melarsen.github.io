# Setting up your username.github.io Page

When you setup GitHub pages, by default your content is available at `https://<GITHUB_USERNAMNE>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/`.

However, if you create a repo with the exact name `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io`, GitHub will automatically turn GitHub Pages on, and make this content avialable at `https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/`. Kind of like your GitHub home page!

This also works for organizations using a repo named `<GITHUB_ORGANIZATION>.github.io`.

> For example my github user is melarsen, so I created a repo called `melarsen.github.io`:
> https://melarsen.github.io/

This setup also has the added benefit that your `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io` website is the root of your other websites using GitHub Pages. So you can place a favicon (or other shared root files) in your `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io` repo and it will be used by sites such as  `https://<GITHUB_USERNAMNE>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/`.
